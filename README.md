# Kaggle Playground 4: Binary Classification with Bank Churn Dataset

This repository contains code and resources for binary classification using a Bank Churn dataset. The project is structured as follows:

## Requirements
- `requirements.txt`: Contains all Python packages required to replicate the environment used for the project.

## 01_import_data
This folder handles importing and exporting the data from the competition. It consists of two CSV files: one for training and one for testing.

## 02_prepare_data
In this folder, the data is prepared for the models, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted.

## 03_models
This folder contains notebooks for running models on the data. Each notebook is titled with the model type (e.g., XGBoost) and contains various iterations of the same model type.

## 04_submissions
Here you'll find the submissions, each titled with the model type followed by a number (e.g., `model_type_##.csv`).

## Usage
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Gomezj1907/kaggle-playground-4`
- Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Navigate to the respective folders to explore the code and data.
- Execute the notebooks in the `03_models` folder to run different models and analyze their performance.
- Access the submissions in the `04_submissions` folder.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different models for binary classification using the Bank Churn dataset.
